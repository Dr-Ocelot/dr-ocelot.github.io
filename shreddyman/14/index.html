        <p>Evilman, after being still for seven years, was very stiff and could barely move at all. Shreddyman, however, went and got a sandwich twenty minutes before the player finally closed all the doors in the hotel, because he could use his super Shreddy Senses to walk right through the sepia rainbow monochrome. Shreddyman walked up to Evilman and slapped him into defeat. “AUGH!” screeched Evilman, “YOU MAY HAVE WON THIS TIME, BUT I WILL HAVE MY REVENGE!”</p>
        <p>Evilman jumped over Shreddyman with an incredible leap! He ran through the mall, being sprayed with perfume. Shreddyman gave chase, but also got perfumed. Evilman pulled out a can of canned bread (which was cherry flavoured, btw) and shrunk so he could run through the door. Shreddyman just shredded through the door, because he thought that the main plot device wasn’t being used enough. Evilman ran outside and stopped. Shreddyman stopped right behind him. The old guy stood before them.</p>
        <p>“WHAT is your name?” he asked.</p>
        <p>“Evilman! Come on! I don’t have time for this!” shouted Evilman.</p>
        <p>“WHAT is your quest?”</p>
        <p>“To run away from the Shreddyman!”</p>
        <p>“WHAT is the capital of Assyria?”</p>
        <p>Evilman, stunned, shouted “I DON’T KNOW THAT!!”</p>
        <p>Then, Evilman flew into the pit with a devastating “AUGH!!!” noise. Shreddyman had won. Just as Shreddyman was trying to go home he heard somebody call out to him.</p>
        <p>“WHAT is your name?”</p>
        <p>“Sir Shreddyman of Detroit”</p>
        <p>“WHAT is your quest?”</p>
        <p>“To go home.”</p>
        <p>“WHAT is the airspeed velocity of an unladen swallow?”</p>
        <p>“What do you mean? An African or European swallow?”</p>
        <p>“WHAT!?!? I DON’T KNOW THAT!!!” shouted the old man, who had the same fate as Evilman. “AUUUUGH” was the last word that Shreddyman heard that day, because he went home and decided to stay there until a sequel was written.</p>
