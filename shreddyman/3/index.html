        <p>When he regained consciousness, Reggie looked around and saw a bunch of scientists bound to the wall by duct tape. Reggie’s head felt quite heavy, too. When he felt his forehead, he felt a large metal object on it. He rushed to the nearest bathroom, which was three millimetres away, and looked in the mirror. There was a paper shredder attached to his cranium! Reggie dug at the duct tape but couldn’t get it off, for it was duct tape made in a Nokia factory! Reggie screamed and started to run in circles, but then he bruised his arm on the sink, bashed his shin on the toilet and then fell shredder first into the bathtub.</p>
        <p>The sound of a shredder smashing porcelain awoke the Ductapeuos Raptaerious and sent it running towards his escaped victim. Reggie was just coming out of the bathroom when the Ductapeuos Raptaerious found him. Reggie shrieked. The Ductapeuos Raptaerious leapt at Reggie. Luckily for Reggie, the paper shredder randomly turned on, and the Ductapeuos Raptaerious jumped right into it and got shredded to bits. Despite being called the Ductapeuos Raptaerious, it was actually made of scotch tape. All of the duct tape, besides the strips attached to Reggie, dissipated, leaving Reggie to say “It’s another one of those plot devices.” All of the scientists lifted him up and chanted his name until they carried him to a hole in the wall and threw him in. On the other side of the hole, there was a room with a golden thing on the top. The golden thing started draining air into it, so Reggie had to just stand there while he got sucked up! He was falling down a golden shaft until it launched him outside. When he hit the ground, he exclaimed “Ow! That hurt so very much!”</p> <a href='../4/' class='btn center-block text-center' style='width: 100px;'>Next Act</a> </div>
