        <p>Shreddyman walked up to the door and noticed that there was no door. The door kept on disappearing and reappearing. “That’s annoying,” mumbled Shreddyman. Suddenly John Cena punched a hole in the wall and walked out. Shreddyman took the opportunity and just jumped in. The inside of the evil base was very bright, so Shreddyman had to whip out one of his darks so he could see.

        <p>“So,” said the silhouette, “I see you made it past the tiny door and the super highly realistic mall, quite feats they are, but, however astounded I am that you didn’t die from all the perfume, you will still never beat me!” the silhouette stepped out of the shadows to reveal...</p> <a href='../11/' class='btn center-block text-center' style='width: 100px;'>Next Act</a> </div>
