        <p>Seven years ago, there was a police officer named Reggie Fiddledibble. He was dying of paint poisoning due to the consumption of one too many Blue Bananas©. He was lying on the floor next to his bed—because he thought the floor was more comfortable—when he felt like not dying. Reggie pulled out his Enclosed Instruction Book and looked up the secrets to immortality. It had turned out that the secret to being immortal is by being Wario, going way too fast for everyone or drinking some “super-secret drinky thing” that they kept in Area 52, which is next door to Area 51. Reggie strapped on his trusty jetpack that he kept in his back pocket and walked to Area 52.</p> <a href='../2/' class='btn center-block text-center' style='width: 100px;'>Next Act</a> </div>
