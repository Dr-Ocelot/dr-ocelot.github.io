        <p> As it turned out, the moon wasn’t the best place for a secret base. It sounded cool, but when it was all said and done, there was really no atmosphere (HAH! Get it? No? Aww…). Aside from that, now with the power armour equipped, Shreddyman could fly, shoot lasers and scan enemies with this really cool document scanner that comes with every “As seen on TV” shredder. Of course, for the scanner to work, the enemies have to go through the scanner, meaning they need to be paper thin, because it is “As seen on TV” material, but the concept was neat. Also it turned out that the timeless butler thing is copyrighted, so that guy lost his job, and Shreddyman got a maid instead. But then feminists tore down his lair, so he just bought a rented a one-bedroom apartment and called it a day.</p> <a href='../7/' class='btn center-block text-center' style='width: 100px;'>Next Act</a> </div>
