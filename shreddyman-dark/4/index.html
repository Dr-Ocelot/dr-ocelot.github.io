        <p>Reggie liked the satisfaction of being praised as a superhero, so he decided to become one. After many tries on the name, he went through the names of “Super Shredder”, “Righteous Ripper” and “Doctor Dissection”, but he took a liking to the cheesiest name of all: Shreddyman. He strapped on his trusty jetpack and ran out of the supermarket that he was in for the last twenty minutes. As soon as his foot hit the pavement outside, there was an explosion down the street. It was his house! Smoke was encapsulating the entire lot, so he couldn’t see. However, with his super Shreddy Senses—which is totally not a rip-off of Spiderman—he was able to hear a moderately familiar laugh. “I can’t see through these clouds,” said Shreddyman, “I hope I can get rid of them.” Then he looked into the camera and said <strong><em>“GET THE HINT!?!?!1”</em></strong> Shreddyman ran into the flames and looked around, but the culprit was gone. “D’oh I missed!” said Shreddyman.</p> <a href='../5/' class='btn center-block text-center' style='width: 100px;'>Next Act</a> </div>
