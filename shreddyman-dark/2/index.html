        <p>Twenty minutes later, he knocked on the front door of Area 52 and said that he needed the super-secret drinky thing and that if he didn’t get it he would explode. When he got inside, he took off his jetpack and flew over the senior scientist named Billiard Bobykinns. Billiard had worked there for seventy years, and then he got fired, rehired and then worked there for eighty-eight years after that. There was an awkward silence as they passed through the halls of the base, so Reggie tried to start a conversation. “So… you got any family?” Reggie questioned. Billiard just shrugged off the comment and kept walking with an emotionless expression. After an hour of silence, they arrived at the room where the super-secret drinky thing was <em>supposed</em> to be, but it wasn’t there. It turned out that Reggie’s arch-nemesis, Fiddle Reggiedibble, had already drunk it. “Oh no!” shouted Reggie, “How cood dis happon?!?” Approximately three seconds after he said this, there was a loud crushing noise.</p>
        <p>“OH MY!” spoke Billiard, “The Ductapeuos Raptaerious (that’s ‘Duc-tape-ee-us rap-tair-ee-us’ for all you mispronouncing folks) has broken out of its cage” There was a loud roar followed by a Wilhelm Scream. “RUN, REGGIE, RUN!” shouted Billiard, “I’LL TAKE CARE OF THIS BEAST!!”</p>
        <p>“IS THERE REALLY A REASON FOR THIS SECTION OF THE STORY TO HAVE ALL CAPS!??!?” asked Reggie.</p>
        <p>“STOP BREAKING THE FOURTH WALL!” angrily yelled Billiard. Reggie ran from where the sound came from originally, but with every turn, the noises were in front and closer to him.</p>
        <p>“It’s just one of those plot devices,” murmured Reggie. Then, Reggie remembered that he was suffering from paint poisoning, so he suddenly fell to a crawl. He tried to cower in a corner but the monster found him, and, despite Reggie’s girly screams of terror, covered his face with duct tape.</p> <a href='../3/' class='btn center-block text-center' style='width: 100px;'>Next Act</a> </div>
